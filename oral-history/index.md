Shigeko Sasamori’s first hand account of the Hiroshima bomb is a real, grotesque and uncomfortable experience to listen to. However, considering the environment it’s a correct way to present the tragedy of war. Comparatively, Clifton's example of Sadako as his experience in understanding the individual damage of the war is a much less intense experience. Some scholars argue that the story of Sadako as presented by Eleanor Coerr is a misrepresentation and they would rather an account like Shigeko Sasamori’s realism be used to describe the war rather than Coerr’s lighter touch. However, it appears that Coerr’s book despite being not wholly accurate is a beneficial teaching material for WW2 while lighter than testimony like Shigeko’s.<br><br>
                  Clifton’s explanation on how he learned about Hiroshima from history class is a hollow explanation of the tragedy. Given a statistic and a few photographs, the students were expected to be finished learning about America’s use of the atomic bomb and to move on to the next subject. As Clifton mentions, he did not feel any strong connection to the events of Hiroshima since he had no idea what it was like to be around an atomic bomb explosion or be apart of the rebuilding process. That’s why when his son explained the story of Sadako to him when he was 40 years old, he finally found a connection to the events that his grandfather willingly initiated.[^1]  <br><br>
    The story of Sadako commonly taught comes from two books, a picture book and a short novel both written by Coerr. However, both books neglect to mention much of the bomb itself for instance in the picture book, the only mention of the bomb comes from three sentences metaphorically alluding to the bomb saying, “I remember the Thunderbolt,” Sadako whispered. “There was the flash of a million suns. Then the heat prickled my eyes like needles”. Compared to other picture books specifically published in Japan and accounts of the bomb like the grim book <a href="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0970/5584/products/DSC_5915_774e965a-261c-4f6e-8d42-8913ac1c29bf_1024x1024.JPG?v=1508880457">Hiroshima No Pika</a> and Shigeko’s story, a greater emphasis on the destruction of the bomb and fighting for survival is described. Furthermore, Shigeko is very descriptive while describing the plane first as a thing of beauty and later when the bombs drop her voice seems to tremble<a href="#" onclick="javascript:seek(30)"> (0:30)</a> unlike Sadako's lack of any mention of the plane.[^4][^6]<br><br>
                  The chapter book mentioned by Clifton<a href="#" onclick="javascript:seek(178)"> (2:58)</a>[^5] while having more details and intended for an older audience than the picture book still has similar issues in it. For instance, in the novel, the monument funded by her classmates for the Children’s Peace Memorial was described as representing the story of her death and the hope for a peaceful future. However, the monument was funded out of anger towards the perpetrators of war and the use of the atomic bomb. Also, both books might not have the intention to demean the Japanese suffering however, the emphasis on Sadako being a tragic heroine takes away from the other thousands of children perishing or suffering because of the bomb. The foccus on Sadako is unlike Shigeko's story where she is one of the many people moving to safty while suffering massive skin loss and burns <a href="#" onclick="javascript:seek(114)"> (1:54)</a>.[^6]<br><br>
                              Despite the negative criticism on Sadako's story, it’s true that the effect it has on the world is a positive influence towards anti war ideology. It educated people like Clifton to a topic he previously felt disconnected from and furthermore, the book educated his own son at ten years old, an age when Clifton has probably not even heard about the war much less read through a book on how the atom bomb affected an individual like Sadako.[^5]<br><br>
                  Ali A. Al-Jafar, a professor at Kuwait University did a study to find if the story of Sadako was effective in teaching students about the effects of World War 2 and relating Sadako’s struggles to other tragedies with similar effects. The students he tested this on sympathized with Sadako after going through her story, making paper cranes and relating Hiroshima to Kuwait prisoners of war.[^2]  Furthermore, in a study guided by Aki Sakuma, it was found that 14 out of 28 students in a teacher’s college thought to use the picture book Sadako in their classes. Only eight of these students chose none of the books offered since they want to distance children from war. First hand accounts like Shigeko’s would be out of the question for young children and maybe even at the age of 10 like Wesley for being too explicit.[^3]  However, the story of Sadako because of its toned-down nature is a beneficial way to teach children and youth about WW2 without being too graphic despite its inaccuracies.<br><br>
                  Shigeko’s story and Sadako both have a place in discussing World War 2, the effects of war and, nuclear disarmament. Shigeko’s more realistic story as spoken by herself is powerful in conveying the terror and fear she has as she relives her past while sharing it to the world. The story of Sadako differs from Shigeko's story by glossing over experiences that Sadako realisticly might have had (poverty) in-favour of conveying a desire for peace so that other children will not have to suffer. It’s apparent that how the presentation of history has come a long way from how Clifton learned about WW2 at most likely a middle school textbook and today where children experience the tale of Sadako and can personally hear Shigeko’s harrowing experience.
