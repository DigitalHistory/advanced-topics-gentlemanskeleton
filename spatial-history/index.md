# Introduction
The map pictured gives an overview of the Vancouver Harbour and, the Burrad Inlet. At first glance, there are only 2 ways to cross either body of water from the Lions Gate Bridge or the Second Narrows Bridge. However, to reduce vechle traffic, there is also a Seabus terminal that ferries foot passengers from Vancouver to Lonsdale Quay in North Vancouver. This current system is the product of about a century of urban development and growth in Vancouver leading to a greater need for transportation.

# History



The first travel method from North Vancouver to Vancouver was with a rowboat captained by Jack Thomas, a deserter from the Royal Navy during the mid 1860s. Jack’s rowboating operation was be able to accommodate the needs of Vancouver residents considering that the population of Vancouver was relatively low. Over the years until 1893, the growing population of Vancouver did require more ships to keep up with the commercial and residential needs. These ships were: The Sea Foam, the Chinaman, the Lily, the Elonora, and the Senator.[^1] [^2]

The problem with an entire transportation system hinged on six small passenger boats in a technologically advancing world is that it was not able to keep up with Vancouver’s population growth. That’s why the city of Vancouver made a deal with the Union Steamship Company to provide them with a steamship. Steam ships while more effective than 6 small boats create a new set of problems for Vancouver showing the cracks in the efficiency of an entire transportations system based on ships. The first problem is that steam ships are very expensive to maintain. The first steam ship, the [Norvan](http://www.nauticapedia.ca/Gallery/images/107725_Norvan_web.jpg) (renamed North Vancouver Ferry No. 1) had frequent boiler malfunctions and neded many repairs. On top of the cost to repair the Norvan, ships had to be rented to keep the ferry service running while Norvan was in repair. Because of the constant need for repairs the city of North Vancouver chose to cut services to keep costs down. However, this backfired since the original captain used this as a reason to quit, thus new inexperienced captains ended up damaging both the boat and wharves while getting used to the ship. It ended up costing the municipality so much that they had to sell the ferry operation to a private business called the North Vancover Ferry and Power Company. The company ended up purchasing five other steam ships to keep up with the growing demand to cross the harbour.[^1] [^3]

West Vancouver, due to their distance to Lonsale Quay required their own ferry port. However, the population of West Vancouver is quite low and does not have as much as a need for a ferry service compared to North Vancouver. Despite the small need, John Lawson started the West Vancouver Ferry Company in 1909. Over the course of two years, Lawson and partners purchased one other ferry but in 1912, it became apparent that this was a failing business. Lawson put $11 500 into the company which would be roughly $252 425[^7] today, he was only able to sell it for $6 000 to the Municipality of West Vancouver. West Vancouver bought the company because it would be impossible to have a functioning city unable to travel to the Vancouver mainland therefore they had no choice but to buy the company and maintain the ferry service. Under the city, six other ships were purchased between 1912 to 1936.[^4]

The West Vancouver ferry trip to Vancouver takes roughly 25 min and costs 10 cents later rising to 15 cents. However, the process to ride the ferry would be longer than 25 min since you would have to include the wait time to get on the ferry and, the time it takes to disembark. Furthermore, delays would be expected to prevent any serious accidents and ship to ship collisions since the harbour has many other vessels for commercial purposes.[^4]  

It became apparent in the 20th century that the ferry system would not be able to keep up with the three cities growth and bridges would have to be constructed for vehicle travel. The first major bridge built was the Second Narrows Bridge in North Vancouver providing access for cars and trains. Eventually, the bridge was outfitted with a center lift span due to the [constant damages from large freighters](https://tce-live2.s3.amazonaws.com/media/media/df83fd6c-c2d8-46ab-b632-7bad40ce34a8.jpg) being wedged under the bridge. [However, the lifting process of the bridge was long and frequent](http://searcharchives.vancouver.ca/uploads/r/null/9/4/940692/c9f4cd47-531b-43a2-a740-35ad7dc2fdfd-A30052.jpg). For instance, in 1952 the lift had to be raised over 5000 times. A second and larger bridge was built right beside it and replaced its predicessor in 1968 to stop the need for raising and lowering the bridge.[^5]  

The last bridge and major development in the 20th century was the Lions Gate Bridge. Alfred James Towle Taylor convinced the Guinness brewing company to fully finance the construction of West Vancouver property which included a bridge connecting West Vancouver to Vancovuer. The Guinness family paid $5 873 837.17 (roughly $128 930 725.88) [^7] to build the bridge and created a [toll booth](http://archives.westvancouver.ca/destinationstimewalk/routes/ambleside/sites/subSites/40S.004.WVA.BPP.html) on the bridge as well costing drivers [$1.25 per week](http://archives.westvancouver.ca/destinationstimewalk/routes/ambleside/sites/subSites/146.WVA.FIR.html) (21.66 today[^7]). Compared to the other projects, this was by far the most expensive and extreme. However, the payoff would greatly benefit West Vancouver who could only rely on the ferry to get to Vancouver as the Second Narrows was much too far for everyday use. The two bridges caused the end of the West Vancouver ferry service in 1947 and North Vancouver’s ferry service in 1958.[^6]

# Present

While the ferry services ended because of the two bridges, they are far from perfect solutions to a traffic problem. For instance, Lions Gate had its two lanes extended into three lanes but there is still large amounts of congestion and traffic. That’s why the current Seabus service from North Vancouver to Vancouver is a welcomed system to alleviate the bridge traffic. Vancouver transportation has gone through changes from the late 19th century to the 20th century but, the realities have not changed where Vancouver is reliant on a secondary transportation service on top of their bridge service. If you take away one system, the transfered stress to another will not keep up with the demand.[^6]
